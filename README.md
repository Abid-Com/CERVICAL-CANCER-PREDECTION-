# CERVICAL-CANCER-PREDECTION-
In this project, we tackled the challenge of classifying cervical cancer using various machine learning algorithms.
1. Data Preprocessing & Imputation: We started by handling missing values in our dataset. Using statistical imputation techniques, we ensured that all our features were clean and ready for analysis.

2. Feature Engineering: To avoid redundancy and multicollinearity, we dropped highly correlated features, streamlining our dataset for better model performance.

3. Balancing the Dataset: The dataset was highly imbalanced with a significant class disparity. We applied the SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to balance the classes, ensuring our models were trained on a representative dataset.

4. Model Training: We trained multiple classifiers, including:
 - Decision Tree
 - Logistic Regression
 - Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
 - XGBoost Classifier
 - Random Forest Classifier
5. Model Evaluation: Each model was evaluated using confusion matrices and classification reports to understand their precision, recall, and F1-scores. We also plotted accuracy
 comparisons to visualize the performance of each model.
6. Results: The models showed promising results with accurate classification of cervical cancer cases. The comparison of different models provided insights into the strengths
and weaknesses of each algorithm.
Hereâ€™s a sneak peek into our results:
- Confusion Matrices: Visual representation of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives for each model.
- Accuracy Comparison: A bar plot showcasing the accuracy of all the classifiers we used.
